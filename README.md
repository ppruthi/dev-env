This directory contains basic files to setup developement environment that I use personally.

What we have included here are:
- bashrc
- bash profile
- vimrc

It contains stuff mostly picked from online resources and things that I learnt while experimenting myself.

DISCLAIMER:
The "stuff" here may contain bugs, redundant information and might be a security risk.
Please understand the risks before you proceed.
