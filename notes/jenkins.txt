 Making a machine a jenkins slave:

 - WEIRDLY, the known_hosts for the ROOT user should have the slave keys
  identified first in order for the master to connect to slave.
 - add jenkins user with its home dir chown'ed to itself
 - make password for jenkins as configured for the user on jenkins master
 - add jenkins as a sudoer (add following line to sudoer file)
	jenkins ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pkg, /usr/sbin/reboot, /usr/sbin/svcadm, /usr/sbin/svccfg, /usr/bin/docker
- this basically adds jenkins as a sudoer that is not required to add password
for the given commands
- add the node to the jenkins master - it should connect and configure on
console without any issue.
- YOU ARE GOLDEN :)
